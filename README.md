# kanban
graphql based kanban board. Created this to get more familiar with the following technologies:

- react semantic-ui
- React hooks
- GraphQL
- TypeORM
- type-graphql

Still a work in progress.

### Usage:

Terminal 1
```
$ cd backend
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Terminal 2
```
$ cd frontend
$ npm i 
$ npm start
```

- Open localhost:3000 in a browser to see UI.
- Open localhost:4000 in a browser to see GraphQL Playground.
